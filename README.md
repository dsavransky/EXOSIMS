EXOSIMS makes use of Astropy, a community-developed core Python package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration, 2013).

EXOSIMS optionally makes use of Forecaster (http://ascl.net/1701.007).

EXOSIMS optionally makes use of NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility's SPICE system components (https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/).

EXOSIMS optionally uses values from: Mamjek, E. "A Modern Mean Dwarf Stellar Color and Effective Temperature Sequence", http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~emamajek/EEM_dwarf_UBVIJHK_colors_Teff.txt, Version 2017.09.06

EXOSIMS development is supported by NASA Grant Nos. NNX14AD99G (GSFC), NNX15AJ67G (WPS) and NNG16PJ24C (SIT).
