        Tests that get_home_dir works in muiltiple OS environments.

        Test method: Uses unittest's mock library to create fake OS environment
        and paths to see if get_dirs returns the correct home directory. Because
        get_dirs returns assertionerrors when the homedir isn't real, use the
        assertion message itself to check that the homedir is correct.

        This assumes that the os library does its job correctly as the mocking
        library will overwrite whatever os has stored for testing purposes.

        This method also assumes that winreg works as expected.
