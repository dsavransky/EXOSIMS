class TimeKeeping(object):
    """TimeKeeping class template.
    
    This class keeps track of the current mission elapsed time
    for exoplanet mission simulation.  It is initialized with a
    mission duration, and throughout the simulation, it allocates
    temporal intervals for observations.  Eventually, all available
    time has been allocated, and the mission is over.
    Time is allocated in contiguous windows of size "duration".  If a
    requested interval does not fit in the current window, we move to
    the next one.
