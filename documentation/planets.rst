PlanetPhysicalModel
======================

Planet physical model modules provide methods for calculating planet properties as functions of planet parameters.  These include density models (for converting between planet mass and radius) and any photometric models (for evaluating albedo/phase as a function of orbit size/location).


.. _planetpopulation:
   
PlanetPopulation
====================

Planet population modules encode the distributions defining a planet population, and provide methods for sampling from these distributions.
