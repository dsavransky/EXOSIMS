    photometric completeness
        The probability of observing a planet, belonging to a particular population, and with a particular instrument, given that one exists about a given target star, subject only to the photometric constraints (i.e., contrast capabilities of that instrument on that star within the allotted integration time).  That is, the integral over the probability density function of the population of :math:`\Delta{\textrm{mag}}` over the :math:`\Delta{\textrm{mag}}` limits imposed by the instrument.

    obscurational completeness
        The probability of observing a planet, belonging to a particular population, and with a particular instrument, given that one exists about a given target star, subject only to the geometric constraints.  That is, the integral over the probability density function of the population of angular separation between the :term:`IWA` and :term:`OWA` of the instrument.

    completeness
        Typically this refers to obsucrational and photometric completeness: the probability of observing a planet, belonging to a particular population, and with a particular instrument, given that one exists about a given target star, subject to both the photometric and geometric constraints of the instrument.  That is, the integral over the joint probability density function of the population of :math:`\Delta{\textrm{mag}}` and angular separation over the :math:`\Delta{\textrm{mag}}` limits, and between the :term:`IWA` and :term:`OWA` of the instrument. For a full definition, see [Brown2005]_.

    IWA
        Inner working angle.  Minimum angular separation between an observable planet and its host star.

    OWA
        Outer working angle.  Maximum angular separation between an observable planet and its host star.

    SNR
        Signal to noise ratio.  Typically the estimated signal (i.e., planet flux) scaled by the variance of the estimated noise.

    :math:`\Delta{\textrm{mag}}`
        Difference in magnitude between star and planet.  Equal to :math:`\log_{10}\left(\frac{F_P}{F_S}\right)` where :math:`F_P` is the planet flux and :math:`F_S` is the stellar flux.

    MCMS
        Monte Carlo Mission Simulation.  See [Savransky2010]_.

    face-on
        Orbit with 0 inclination.  The orbital radius vector always lays within the plane of the sky and the phase angle is always 90 degrees.

    edge-on
        Orbit with 90 degree inclination.  The phase angle can be any value between 0 and 180 degrees.

    phase angle
        The illuminant-object-observer angle.  The angle between the planet-star and planet-observer vectors. 

    QE
        Quantum Efficiency. The ratio of the number of charge carriers collected at the readout terminal to the number of photons hitting the detector surface.

    FWHM
        Full-Width at Half-Maximum

    PSF
        Point spread function.  The impulse response of an optical system.
