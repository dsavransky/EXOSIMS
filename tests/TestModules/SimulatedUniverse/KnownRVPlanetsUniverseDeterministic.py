        Generate the planetary systems for the current simulated universe.
        This routine populates arrays of the orbital elements and physical 
        characteristics of all planets, and generates indexes that map from 
        planet to parent star.

        Parameters are generated in a deterministic fashion by setting
        error/perturbation terms to zero.  So for example, instead of the planet
        mass being determined by the catalog mass plus a random perturbation
        scaled by the error bars in the catalog (as for the ordinary
        KnownRVPlanetsUniverse), the perturbation is set to zero.  
        Very few inclinations are known at all, so to get some diversity,
        the inclination is set to 0 degrees for "a" planets, 10 for "b", etc.

        If given, the rvPlanetOutputFile is written with a CSV summary of
        selected planet attributes.
